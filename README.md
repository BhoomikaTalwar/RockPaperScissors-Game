This project is a Python implementation of the classic "Rock-Paper-Scissors" game, where one player is the computer and the other is the user. The game offers a simple, interactive experience where the user competes against the computer, which makes random choices for its moves.

Features:
1. User vs. Computer Gameplay: The user selects either Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer randomly generates its choice.
2. Randomization: The computer’s moves are randomly selected, ensuring a fair and unpredictable experience.
3. User Input Validation: The program ensures that the user’s input is valid, prompting them to re-enter if necessary.
4. Multiple Rounds: The game can be played for multiple rounds, keeping track of scores and announcing the final winner.
5. Command Line Interface: The game runs in the terminal or command line, making it lightweight and easy to use.

Game Rules:
1. Rock beats Scissors
2. Scissors beats Paper
3. Paper beats Rock

The game announces the winner of each round based on the player’s and computer’s choices.

Technologies Used:
1. Python (for game logic)
2. HTML (for the structure of the interface)
3. CSS (for styling the interface)
